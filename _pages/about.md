I am a PhD student in the [Goodrich group](https://goodrich.ista.ac.at) at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://ista.ac.at), developing theoretical and computational tools for programmable self-assembly.
My research sits at the intersection of physics, biology, and computer science, and has been published in _Nature Physics_, _PNAS_, and _Physical Review Letters_.
I am broadly interested in the principles behind collective organization in biology and physics, and how these principles can be exploited for the rational design of target properties and behavior.

Previously, I completed my master's degree at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.at), where I worked on microswimmer locomotion. I also spent a semester studying piano at [Berklee College of Music](https://college.berklee.edu).
Beyond my research, I am an avid musician and photographer, and I have recently begun learning Mandarin Chinese.
